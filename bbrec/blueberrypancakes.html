            <p>
            <pre>
                i dont know exactly when i discovered this. possibly during covid  <br>
                i was always a big fan of pancakes - more precisely chocolate chip ones <br>
                which reminds me i havent had those in a long time, i should - soon <br>
                ill tell you what blueberries were available more often than chocolate <br>
                back in those healthy days im joking i actually dont know if theyre over <br>
                but one day. maybe. i forgot about these since there were no bluberries in <br>
                where i moved to for uni . i wish there were. could have been the great savior <br>
                now im blabbering but anyway i discovered thes back again at home. after a phase of <br>
                great failure and self destruction for a lack of a better phrase. i came back to <br>
                THE blueberry pancakes. the recipe now is what i eat atleast twoce a week for <br>
                breakfast. sometimes lunch too. sometimes dinner too. its easier this way
