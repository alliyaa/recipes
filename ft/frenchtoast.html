                November 2023. my 13 year old brother has got some sudden - very passionate - <br>
                craze for cooking. bro's favorite two things to make are breakfast items.  <br>
                eggs and french toast. mostly eggs though. however i hate eggs so i present  <br>
                the other option which i have eat. its been tried and tested  and approved yall<br>
                btw we really gotta start teaching these kids to cook young. i still remember <br>
                that one kid called carter from tiktok. the mom was laura i think. that child <br>
                could cook better than i can. he did have some obsession with cassdias but same. <br>
