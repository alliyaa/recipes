            <p>
            <pre>
                It's 2019. Its June. Somwhere very late June. and we're in Sweden. <br>
                We're at my dad's friends house and there is a vanilla sponge cake. <br>
                its the best i have ever had in my entire life genuinely. i think  <br>
                about it often. We're about to leave their cottage core (yes!) house<br>
                she had put it on the kicthen couter. my sister ws supposed to pick it up <br>
                she forgets. sometimes when we fight i bring that <em> crime</em> of hers up <br>
                had she picked it up we mightve guessed the ingredients. we should ask her. <br>
                <br>
